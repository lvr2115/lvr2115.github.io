A website is a collection of related pages, written in HTML, hosted on server, retrievable using an easy-to-remember name. 

Do we need to know HTML? No, this isn't 1997. 


It's better to have on set of rules that apply site-wide for styling. This is like SAS ODS. It needs to be called _site.yml. index.rmd has to exist in your webite and it HAS to be named like that, with lower case all.

#Build website re-knits everything on your website. If it's a site wide change and you want something to appear in every page, building website is a great way to do so.
# Go to the P8105 website and github to look at how Jeff did things like drop downs
