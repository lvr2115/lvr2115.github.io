<div align="left">**About** 

I graduated from the [University of Florida](https://phhp.ufl.edu/) in 2020 with a dual degree in Political Science and Public Health. During my time at the University of Florida, I worked in state government, non-profit organizations and clinical environments to explore the intersection between politics and public health. 

I am now pursuing my Master's in Public Health at [Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/population-family-health) with a certificate in Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. I am also a recipient of the merit-based Huo Public Service Fellowship.
