You can add text

* and lists
* with extra bullets

You can *FORMAT* and **bold**.

This is a [link](google.com) to a good data science tool. Here's a link to the [about](about.html) page.

You can also still use R! 

```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = runif(100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )

plot_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point()
```

# Here's a new section

My cat's name is Ted.

It's better to have on set of rules that apply site-wide for styling. This is like SAS ODS. It needs to be called _site.yml. index.rmd has to exist in your webite and it HAS to be named like that, with lower case all.

#Build website re-knits everything on your website. If it's a site wide change and you want something to appear in every page, building website is a great way to do so.
